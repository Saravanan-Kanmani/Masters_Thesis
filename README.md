The COVID-19 epidemic has been a worldwide health disaster that has affected millions of individuals leading to many deaths. While vaccines have been developed to prevent the spread of virus, there has been some hesitancy among people to accept them. In this research, the aim is to analyze COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets to gain insights into the common sentiments shared by people on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Openly available dataset that contains tweets related to COVID-19 vaccine used for this research. Lexicon-based and deep learning methods, BERT and Bi-LSTM with BERT designed to analyze the tweets. A lexicon approach, VADER sentiment tool used to assign sentiments (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral) for the cleaned tweets. The common keywords used in the tweets in each sentiment are visualized using WordClouds. Bootstrap resampling with sample replacement has been performed to solve the class imbalance and resource requirements. The prediction of sentiments was performed using a deep learning methods BERT and Bi-LSTM with BERT word embeddings. The performance of the models evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score. BERT model achieved higher accuracy of 95% and Bi-LSTM with BERT have decent loss trend. The findings of this research could be helpful for public organizations and health authorities to be better prepared for future outbreaks similar to COVID-19.
